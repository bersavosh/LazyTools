# An obbsessive checklist for paper acknowledgments:
This is a generic list, but mainly meant for observational astronomers. Many of these are just a matter of opinion.

### People:
* People who you had small discussions with which lead to improvements in the paper. 
* People from a forum/helpdesk that assisted you.
* People involved in planning/providing access to data/facility/instrument.
* Grants, funds, fellowships and awards that were spent on the project.
* Supervisors and insitutes not directly involved in the project, but supported the funding for it.

### Facilities and data archives:
* Facilities, intruments and observatories you obtained data from **for this project** (i.e., you wrote a proposal and it got approved).
* Facilities, intruments and observatories you obtained **Archival data** from for this project.

### Reduction, analysis, presentation resources:
* Softwares/packages/scripts used for Instrument-specific data reduction and analysis (e.g., CIAO, SAS).
* Softwares/packages/scripts used for generic reduction and analysis (e.g., IRAF, Astropy, HEASOFT).
* Facilities providing computational resources (e.g., AWS). Also the funding resources for the access if any.
* Imaging and plotting packages:
  - If you used `Matplotlib`, then cite [Hunter 2007](http://matplotlib.org/citing.html).
  - If you used DS9 to make images, configure region files, etc., make sure to mention it.

### Archives
* Facilities and archives providing open-access data which were used in the project.
* The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System
* Arxiv
* VizieR
