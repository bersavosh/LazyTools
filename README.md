# LazyTools:
A small collection of naive scripts I've written to run things from the command line.

## 1. GehrelsStat:
A quick script to calculate confidence interval and significance for the photon-starved regime. This is basically a lazy implementation from [Gehrels 1986](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...303..336G). 

## 2. NormStat:
Same as above but for gaussian distribution. Because I'm too forgetful to remember how many 9s there are after the decimal in a 5-sigma confidence!

## 3. GCcat:
A command line tool that returns information about a globular cluster from the [Harris Catalog](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996AJ....112.1487H) ([2010 edition](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~harris/Databases.html)).
